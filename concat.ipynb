    "    'text': \"Hurricane Helene killed more than 100 people in six states as it left a trail of destruction across the southeastern U.S. President Joe Biden briefly talked about the storm Sept. 29 in remarks to reporters at Dover Air Force base, and his response to one question has since been mischaracterized across social media. 'Biden announces ‘$2.4 billion more to Ukraine' but 'No more aid for Hurricane Helene,' a Sept. 30 Facebook post said. We found other posts claiming that Biden said no more aid would be coming for states affected by the storm, with some tying it to aid for Ukraine. These Facebook and Instagram posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. A closer look at his Biden’s full remarks show that he did not rule out future aid for states ravaged by the storm: Reporter: 'Do you have any words for the victims of the hurricane?' Biden: 'Yes, it’s tragic. As a matter of fact, we’re trying to get the exact number. My FEMA advisor’s on the ground in Florida right now. There’s a distinction between the number that FEMA’s used and the ones that are used by the locals. So, it really is amazing. You saw the photographs. It’s stunning. It really is.' Reporter: 'Such a wide area.' Biden: 'We’ve given them all … everything that we have on the ground ahead of time. So, we’re working hard.' Reporter question: 'Are there any more resources the federal government could be giving them?' Biden: 'No, we've given them … We have preplanned a significant amount of it, even though they didn't ask for it yet … hadn't asked for it yet.' What aid has Biden’s administration provided so far? The same day Biden made those comments to reporters, the White House released a fact sheet detailing the administration’s relief efforts. It said Biden directed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to 'determine what more can be done' to speed aid to those having trouble accessing help. The fact sheet describes actions the Biden administration is already taking, including: Approving major disaster declarations for Florida and North Carolina, which lets people immediately access money and resources. FEMA aid could include upfront funds to pay for essential items such as food and water. Money may also be available to repair homes or find temporary shelter. On Sept. 30, Biden said in a news conference that South Carolina had also been granted a major disaster declaration. Declaring emergency declarations for Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama. That declaration allows FEMA to provide direct support to states for emergency activities.\",\n",
